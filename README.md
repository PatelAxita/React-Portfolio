# React + Vite

I took help of this template:
It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules[1].

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I also added things that were not included in this template with the use of FontAwesome.
